# Welcome to Ergonomica! # 
There's only one you.
Why should your workspace be any different?

In the times of  the COVID-19 pandemic, more and more people are working or studying remotely.
Ergonomica¡¯s goal is to help you set up a functional home office that is personalized to meet your needs.
We offer tools to assist in planning your workspace through customized product suggestions based on

Ergonomica takes your persona profile, ergonomic and productivity workspace needs, and supplies you
